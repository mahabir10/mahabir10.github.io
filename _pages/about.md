I am a Software Developer often engaged in open source projects or in free time working for a company. I did my masters in IISC Bangalore, my advisor was Prof. Ambedkar Dukkipati. My masters thesis was on infusing structured knowledge into the deep learning models.

My interest lies in knowing the ins and outs of the machine learning like how using only mathematical tools one can simulate what is going in human brain. In my free time i play ukulele, which i learned recently and got fascinated by its sound and its simplicity. I also am very fond of riding bike and going to very off-beat places and exploring them.

Before doing masters, i did bachelors from IIIT Bhubaneswar, in computer science. Later i appeared for GATE exam and got AIR-29.
